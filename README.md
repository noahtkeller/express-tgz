# express-tgz

express-tgz allows you to do `res.tgz(directory, filename)` in [express](http://expressjs.com/), without creating any intermediary files on disk, and in 100% pure node.

```js
var app = require('express')();
var tgz = require('express-tgz');

app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  res.tgz('/some/directory', 'some_dir.tar.gz');
});

app.listen(3000);
```

## Installation

    $ npm install express-tgz
